Convolution - It is a overlap of two function .For eg - Multiplication of two function is an example of Convolution

Filters/Kernels - Sharing a window to get a convoluted network

Epochs - A complete cycle of forward pass and backward pass for all the training example - In neural network

1x1 Convolution - In CNN when we use filter of dimension of 1*1 .In 3 channel Image it will only squash the 3rd dimension while changing the other two dimension unchanged

3x3 Convolution - it will be a filter which will 3 dimendions in size.

Feature Maps - Output of one filter applied to the previous layer.If we move the filter over the whole input layer volume the resultant output is feature map.

Activation Function - Used to convert liner function into non linear function. It is used to learn the complex decison boundry.

Receptive Field- is a local region on the output value of previous layer that a neuron is connected t0.
